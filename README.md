# 📄 GitHub README: Personal Chatbot (ChatGPT Clone)

## 🧠 Personal Chatbot – ChatGPT Clone (Full-Stack MERN, TypeScript)

### 📚 Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack ChatGPT clone** built using the MERN stack with TypeScript. It enables authenticated users to interact with **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash API** in a conversational interface similar to ChatGPT, supporting chat history and seamless real-time responses.

The project was developed to enhance proficiency in **TypeScript, API integration, authentication handling, and full-stack architecture design.**

## 🔒 Authentication Flow

* Uses JWT for login and route protection
* Separate `/auth` and `/chat` APIs for user management and chat interactions
* Chat history is tied to user accounts

---

## 📜 API Integration

* Integrated with Google’s **Gemini 1.5 Flash API** for AI-powered responses.
* Frontend sends chat prompts to the backend, which fetches the Gemini response and saves it to MongoDB for history retrieval.

---

## 🧪 Testing

* ✅ Unit testing for API endpoints (Optional)
* ✅ Manual testing of login, chat, and history retrieval
* ✅ JWT token validation and protected routes

---

## 🚀 Deployment (Optional)

* Frontend+Backend: Render
* Database: MongoDB Atlas
* Environment variables securely stored for Gemini API keys and JWT secrets

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* User profile management
* Chat categorization or folder system
* Gemini streaming responses (real-time typing effect)
* Multi-threaded conversations
* Rate limiting and token usage tracking
